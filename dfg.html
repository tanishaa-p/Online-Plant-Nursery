                    <h3>Types of Plants</h3>
                    <p>We see a huge variety of plants all around us. Among which few are terrestrial and aquatic plants. Despite this fact, they all have the same parts and the same functions; they appear unique with different types of roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds etc. Therefore, the classification of plants is mainly based on several factors, and they can be further classified based on their height, tenderness of stem, branches and their life cycle.</p>

                    <h3>Plant Care Tips</h3>
                    <p>t’s better to under water your plants than to overwater. Too much water can lead to root rot. Ditch your watering schedule and water your plant only when it needs it. Check the potting mix or soil first to make sure it’s dry at least 2 inches deep below the surface. If your soil looks dark in color, feels moist, and sticks to your finger, your plant has enough water to do it’s thing for now.</p>

               <h2 style="color: brown;">1.​ ​Choose plants based on your light</h2>

Are the plants you love the ones you can have? Our #1 rule of (green) thumb is to determine the amount of natural lightyour space receives, and to choose your plant accordingly. If you’re not sure just by looking, start by figuring out which direction your windows face.

Generally speaking, south-facing windows give bright light, east & west-facing windows give moderate light, and north-facing windows give low light. If there’s something outside your window—for example, a large tree or building—that could obstruct sunlight, make sure to take that into consideration, too. Most houseplants prefer bright, indirect sunlight, but many can tolerate lower light levels (like low light tolerant snake plants and ZZ plants).

If the sun is intense through your windows, you may want to add a sheer curtain to diffuse the light. Cacti and some succulents like aloe can handle brighter, direct sunlight. You don’t want to overexpose or underexpose any plant so keep an eye on them if they're in very bright or very low light.
<h2 style="color: brown;">2.​ Pick plants that work with your schedule</h2>

New to plant parenthood? A busy ​work schedule, social​ ​life, and general forgetfulness can lead to unintentional plant neglect. It’s okay. Some plants can handle that kind of lifestyle. A jet-setter like yourself will enjoy the resilience of low-maintenance and drought-tolerant succulents, ZZ plants, or snake plants, all pretty low key, as long as they have enough light (bright and low light respectively). These should keep looking their best when you return from your next trip.

            <h2 style="color:blueviolet;">Plant Diseases</h2>
            <div class="content">
                plant disease, an impairment of the normal state of a plant that interrupts or modifies its vital functions. All species of plants, wild and cultivated alike, are subject to disease. Although each species is susceptible to characteristic diseases, these are, in each case, relatively few in number. The occurrence and prevalence of plant diseases vary from season to season, depending on the presence of the pathogen, environmental conditions, and the crops and varieties grown. Some plant varieties are particularly subject to outbreaks of diseases while others are more resistant to them. See also list of plant diseases.

            <div class="content">
                Plant propagation is the process of creating new plants. There are two types of propagation: sexual and asexual. Sexual reproduction is the union of the pollen and egg, drawing from the genes of two parents to create a new, third individual. Sexual propagation involves the floral parts of a plant. Asexual propagation involves taking a part of one parent plant and causing it to regenerate itself into a new plant. The resulting new plant is genetically identical its parent. Asexual propagation involves the vegetative parts of a plant: stems, roots, or leaves.
