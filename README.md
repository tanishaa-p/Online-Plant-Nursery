# Online-Plant-Nursery
-	My website is an online plant nursery, dedicated to plant enthusiasts, offering a wide variety of plants, flowers for occasions, gardening tools, and accessories for users to explore.

-	Educational content providing users with tips and guidelines for caring for different types of plants.

-	Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS.

-	The website also offers a Plant chatbot, which may ask the user the occasion/reason for buying plants, preferences in plant size, sunlight etc. and relevant choices to suggest them the right plant to go to buy. 

-	The website may also offer an info bot, that will give the user the functionality to search for a particular plant/flower that would return short information on it, and what that item symbolizes to be in use.
